/**
 * @name Amplitude Modulation
 * @description <p>Amplitude Modulation involves two oscillators, referred
 * to as the carrier and the modulator, where the modulator controls
 * the carrier's amplitude.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The carrier is typically set at an audible frequency (i.e. 440 Hz)
 * and connected to master output by default. The carrier.amp is
 * set to zero because we will have the modulator control its amplitude.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The modulator is typically set to a frequency that is lower than
 * humans can hear (i.e. 1 Hz, or one cycle every second). The modulator
 * is disconnected from master output. Instead, it is connected
 * to the amplitude of the Carrier, like this: carrier.amp(modulator).</p>
 *
 * <p>MouseX controls the amplitude of the modulator from 0 to 1. When
 * the modulator's amplitude is set to 0, the amplitude modulation has
 * no effect.</p>
 * 
 * <p>MouseY controls the frequency of the modulator from 0 to 20hz.
 * Both impact our perception of the Carrier frequency. A subtle amount
 * of Amplitude Modulation can simulate effects such as Tremolo.
 * Ring Modulation is a type of Amplitude Modulation where the original
 * carrier signal is not present.</p>

 * for this example to work in your own project.</em></span></p>
