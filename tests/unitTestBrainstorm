TO DO:
- set up Unit Tests
- write these tests (and more)...


Tab
- click x on a tab closes the currentFile
- click x on a tab closes a tab that is not the currentFile
- click + adds a new tab to the project


Project
- When a new project is created without any options, it loads the default project files
- a new project can be created with existing options:
	- loads the existing files
	- opens the tabs that were open
	- opens the file that was open
	- has the proper name
	- has a date modified
	- has a gistID (if one existed)
	- has an ID

Saving
- files have contents
- files have originalContents
- when a file's contents are modified from the most recently committed version ("pFile.originalContents"), the tab gets an asterisk
- project file's contents are updated in localStorage with every change
- projects can be committed (saved to server).
	- when projects are committed (saved to server),
		- originalContents are reset and no more asterisk next to file names
		- new dateModified
		- project name is added to recentProjects array, and the dropdown menu of recent projects

Loading
- recentProjects can load

Sketches
- can run
- can stop
- can be modified and run again
- can receive mouse position, key events, and touch events (not sure how to test for this)
- run multiple files (test with HTML, CSS, JS)

Settings
- fontSize can be changed
- settings are saved to localStorage
- settings change if a user logs in, based on the user's settings

SketchFrame Runner
- can find javascript and css files linked from index.html, whether using single quotes, double quotes, spaces, or no spaces
